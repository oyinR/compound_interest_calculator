// Compound interest calculator that prompts a user for some inputs, and finally calculates the compound interest value

// step 1 - define a function that we can use to calculate the final value of the compound interest

// step 2 - define a function that would calculate the difference (i.e the effect that compounding has had)


// step 3 - to create a run function that then prompts the user for all necessary inputs required to calculate the final amounts

// step 4 - inside of said function, make a print statement using a template literal string that gives the financial breakdown
